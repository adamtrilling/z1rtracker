# z1rtracker

Tracker for Zelda 1 Randomizer. Not anywhere close to usable yet. But it will be someday.

This tracker is written in Rust and compiles to WebAssembly. To run it:

1) Install Rust Nightly (stable can't target WebAssembly yet)
2) Install [cargo-web](https://github.com/koute/cargo-web)
3) Clone this repository
4) `cargo web start`
5) In your browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

When there's something working, I'll figure out how to host a compiled version so you can use it without setting up a development environment.
